## HR App - Overview

A simple HR application for managing and displaying employee details.

### Note: I deployed my JSON server on Render.com and I am a free user, it might take up to 50 seconds to fetch the data from the backend. Sorry for the inconvenience.

### New features

- Protected route. Only the admin can log in and see the employee list.
- Destructured props for cleaner code.
- Reusable `Button` component with customizable styles.

- Special notification for probation review or anniversary.
